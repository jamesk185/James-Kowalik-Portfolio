#  [Project 1: Pitchfork Scores Data Analysis and Prediction](https://github.com/jamesk185/Project---The-Pitchfork-Effect)

An independent data science project by James Kowalik completed in October 2021.

### Overview:

- Written and programmed in R.
- Data processing and cleaning.
- Writing functions and building new variables, predictors.
- Data analysis.
- Using machine learning to perform prediction.

### Background:

Pitchfork is one of the most widely read online music magazines. It is most famed for its album review scores and 'Best New Music' award system. It assigns a score from 0 to 10 to one decimal place for an album that is released and reviewed by one of their writers. An album which receives a score of higher than 8.0 will often receive 'Best New Music' status- an indicator that it is of particularly high quality and an award which holds a lot of influence in terms of the album's sales and credibility.

The aim of this project will be to explore a dataset of Pitchfork reviews and, ultimately, build a prediction model that attempts to predict the score an album will get when reviewed by Pitchfork. Below, I note some aims, expectations and points of intrigue.

- What is the average score awarded to an album and how does the distribution of scores look?

- If biases exist, where are they? Genre? Review's author? 

- My expectation is that the previous scores given to the artist will provide the best indication of score.

- What predictors can be created to improve prediction? How much can prediction accuracy be improved from using just one predictor (based on previous score(s)) to using multiple?

The below image is taken from the data analysis stage (and the report) and shows correlation between the predictors I built and the score.

# [Project 2: Vizualisation of Climate Data Recorded in Chiyoda, Japan](https://github.com/jamesk185/Vizualisation-of-Climate-Data-Recorded-in-Chiyoda-Tokyo-Japan-Python-)

A data science project completed as part of the *Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python* course by University of Michigan. Completed in December 2021.

### Overview:

- Written and programmed with Python using Jupyter Notebook.
- Data processing and cleaning.
- Data visualization.

### Background:

How have air temperature, total precipitation and relative humidity changed in Chiyoda, Japan over the last century and how do they compare to Michigan, USA?

With the primary focus being on Chiyoda, Tokyo, I will take a broad look at changes in climate condition over the last century in three key areas; air temperature, precipitation and humidity. For means of comparison and further interesting insight, and with the course being conducted by University of Michigan, I will include the air temperature and precipitation data for Ann Arbor, Michigan.

Below is the final produced graphic.
